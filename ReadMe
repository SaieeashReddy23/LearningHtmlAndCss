-> Free Stock Images websites :-

    -> Pexels

-> if we get pics from the stock images , they will be of high quality and our page may take less time to load them . For example hot girl image is of width 800px , if we use width attribute in the image tag , it shows the images adjusted to its width but that massive image is being loaded. so our webpage takes more time to load , so what we can do is , we can reduce the size of the image using photoshop or paint or preview.
